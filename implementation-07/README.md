Question 1. Color the marks by if the QB's school is in the Big Five, Group of Five, or Independent

a. No Restrictions

b. colorblind safe

Explanation

Since there are 3 types of groups I have choosen 3 different colors.
I have assigned highly saturated green and blue with low saturation because it is easier to differentiate between two groups. Whereas if we use two low saturated colors or two high saturated colors it would be some what difficult to identify.

Also these colors are colorblind safe so, I created single graph for both No restrictions and Colorblind safe as same color set is available in both cases.
