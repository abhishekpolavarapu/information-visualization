I implemented the selection and hilighting feature for the Question 1C (VI8) ie for the photocopy safe colors.

When a particular player is selected and if we click on it the bubble corresponding to that particular player is hilighted and bubbles corresponding to remaining players shrinks in size. By this we can make a player stand out from the remaining players.
