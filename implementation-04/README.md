Rule: no unjustified 3d- perspective distortion and occulusion hides information.

I have taken a sample dataset and represented them in barcharts.

The first chart is a bad chart because the bars which are shorter and present at a farther distance are not visible(occulusion hides information) and the bars at the farther distance appears to be smaller in size (perspective distortion)

The second chart is a good one beacause we are not facing any problems that we come across in 3D representation.
