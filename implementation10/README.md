This is a superimposed layer visualization in which each line corresponds to a conference and if we hover on a line a particular conference gets hilighted and the name of the conference will be displayed at the end of line.

Each end of a segment represents a player and when hovered we can see the playername, passing touchdowns and running touchdowns to that particular player.
