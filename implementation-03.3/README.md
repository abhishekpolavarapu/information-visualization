The dataset for this graph contains name, Interaction score and team to which the player belongs to. I have plotted a bubble chart in which the size of bubble varies with the interaction value for each player.Also the team members who belongs to a particular team are assigned to one color.
```
Channels used : Identity channe(color hue), magnitude channel (area)

Marks : Bubbles.

The discriminability is maintained here by representing each team by particular color which satisfies the colour hue property and the size of each player varies with change in the interaction value. As a result the area size property is satisfied.
